<testo_comprensione>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How much water should you drink a day?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adults in the UK today are consuming more water now than in recent years and we are bombarded with messages telling us that drinking litres of water every day is the secret to good health, more energy and great skin. Fuelling this appetite for water is the "8x8 rule": the unofficial advice recommending we drink eight 240ml glasses of water per day, totalling just under two litres, on top of any other drinks. However, it isn't backed by scientific findings&amp;nbsp; nor do UK or EU official guidelines say we should be drinking this much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether you've had fatigue or even dry skin, you've probably been told to drink more water as a cure. In the early 19th Century, people had to be close to death before &lt;b&gt;deigning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;to drink water. Only those reduced to the last stage of poverty satisfied their thirst with water, according to Vincent Priessnitz, the founder of hydropathy. Many people, he added, had never drunk more than half a pint of plain water in one sitting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Water is, of course, important. It carries nutrients and waste products around our bodies, regulates our temperature, acts as a lubricant and shock absorber in our joints. In a healthy body, the brain detects when the body is becoming dehydrated and initiates thirst to stimulate drinking. It also releases a hormone which signals to the kidneys to conserve water by concentrating the urine. While water has no calories, other drinks also hydrate us, including tea and coffee. Although caffeine has a mild diuretic effect, research indicates that tea and coffee still contribute to hydration&amp;nbsp; as well as alcoholic drinks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some studies also suggest fluid consumption can help manage weight. In one study two groups were asked to follow a healthy diet for three months, but only one was told to drink a 500ml glass of water half an hour before eating each meal. The group who drank the water lost more weight than the other group. Nevertheless Barbara Rolls, a professor at University College London, says that any weight loss associated with drinking water is more likely to come from water being used as a substitute for sugary drinks. She says that "the notion that filling up on water before a meal will melt the pounds away is not well established, and water consumed on its own empties out of the stomach really quickly. But if you consume more water through the food you eat, such as soup, this can help fill you up as the water is combined with the food and stays in the stomach for longer."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</testo_comprensione>

Two new studies from MIT suggest that mindfulness, the practice of focusing
one's awareness on the present moment, can enhance academic performance and
mental health in middle schoolers. The researchers found that more mindfulness
correlates with better academic performance, fewer suspensions from school, and
less stress.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Open Sans&amp;quot;,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;
'By definition, mindfulness is the ability to focus attention on the present
moment, as opposed to being distracted by external things or internal thoughts.
If you're focused on the teacher in front of you, or the homework in front of
you, that should be good for learning,' says John Gabrieli, the Grover M.
Hermann Professor in Health Sciences and Technology, a professor of brain and
cognitive sciences, and a member of MIT's McGovern Institute for Brain
Research. The researchers also showed, for the first time, that mindfulness
training can alter brain activity in students. Sixth-graders who received
mindfulness training not only reported feeling less stressed, but their brain
scans revealed reduced activation of the amygdala, a brain region that
processes fear and other emotions, when they viewed images of fearful faces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Open Sans&amp;quot;,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;
Together, the findings suggest that offering mindfulness training in schools
could benefit many students, says Gabrieli, who is the senior author of both
studies. 'We think there is a reasonable possibility that mindfulness
training would be beneficial for children as part of the daily curriculum in
their classroom,' he says. "What's also appealing about mindfulness is that there
are pretty well-established ways of teaching it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Open Sans&amp;quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"&gt;In the moment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Open Sans&amp;quot;,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Open Sans&amp;quot;,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;
Both studies were performed at charter schools in Boston. In one of the papers,
which appears today in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Open Sans&amp;quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"&gt;Behavioral
Neuroscience&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;, the MIT team studied about 100 sixth-graders. Half of
the students received mindfulness training every day for eight weeks, while the
other half took a coding class. The mindfulness exercises were designed to
encourage students to pay attention to their breath, and to focus on the
present moment rather than thoughts of the past or the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Open Sans&amp;quot;,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;
Students who received the mindfulness training reported that their stress
levels went down after the training, while the students in the control group
did not. Students in the mindfulness training group also reported fewer
negative feelings, such as sadness or anger, after the training. About 40 of
the students also participated in brain imaging studies before and after the
training. The researchers measured activity in the amygdala as the students
looked at pictures of faces expressing different emotions. At the beginning of
the study, before any training, students who reported higher stress levels
showed more amygdala activity when they saw fearful faces. This is consistent
with previous research showing that the amygdala can be overactive in people
who experience more stress, leading them to have stronger negative reactions to
adverse events. 'There's a lot of evidence that an overly strong amygdala
response to negative things is associated with high stress in early childhood
and risk for depression,' Gabrieli says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Open Sans&amp;quot;,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;
After the mindfulness training, students showed a smaller amygdala response
when they saw the fearful faces, consistent with their reports that they felt
less stressed. This suggests that mindfulness training could potentially help
prevent or mitigate mood disorders linked with higher stress levels, the
researchers say. Richard Davidson, a professor of psychology and psychiatry at
the University of Wisconsin, says that the findings suggest there could be
great benefit to implementing mindfulness training in middle schools. 'This is
really one of the very first rigorous studies with children of that age to
demonstrate behavioral and neural benefits of a simple mindfulness training,'
says Davidson, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Open Sans&amp;quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"&gt;Evaluating
mindfulness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Open Sans&amp;quot;,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Open Sans&amp;quot;,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;
In the other paper, which appeared in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Open Sans&amp;quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"&gt;Mind, Brain, and Education&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt; in June, the
researchers did not perform any mindfulness training but used a questionnaire
to evaluate mindfulness in more than 2,000 students in grades 5-8. The
questionnaire was based on the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale, which is
often used in mindfulness studies on adults. Participants are asked to rate how
strongly they agree with statements such as 'I rush through activities without
being really attentive to them.' The researchers compared the questionnaire
results with students' grades, their scores on statewide standardized tests,
their attendance rates, and the number of times they had been suspended from
school. Students who showed more mindfulness tended to have better grades and
test scores, as well as fewer absences and suspensions. 'People had not asked
that question in any quantitative sense at all, as to whether a more mindful
child is more likely to fare better in school,' Gabrieli says. 'This is the
first paper that says there is a relationship between the two.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Open Sans&amp;quot;,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;
The researchers now plan to do a full school-year study, with a larger group of
students across many schools, to examine the longer-term effects of mindfulness
training. Shorter programs like the two-month training used in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Open Sans&amp;quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"&gt;Behavioral Neuroscience&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;
study would most likely not have a lasting impact, Gabrieli says. 'Mindfulness
is like going to the gym. If you go for a month, that's good, but if you stop
going, the effects won't last,' he says. 'It's a form of mental exercise that
needs to be sustained.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%"&gt;http://news.mit.edu/2019/mindfulness-mental-health-benefits-students-0826&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;Glossary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;charter school: (in North America) a publicly funded

      <fissa>Melissa , I have retired from my lifelong job and passion of playing the piano in an orchestra. At least three or four days a week in the morning before breakfast I
write letters at my desk in an upstairs bedroom that has become my 'writing room'. 'I find it an enjoyable experience as important as talking to people'. As I am deaf in one ear, I find the telephone difficult and I don't have email. Letters written by hand are an exchange of energy between people. It's like the energy that passes between a musician and audience during a concert, which doesn't happen with the electronic mail and a keyboard.</fissa>
